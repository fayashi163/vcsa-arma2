Cooper was tested with military skills at the base, including shooting range with Styer AUGs. After that, he was elevated to PFC. Cooper will serve at the sentry near Spookdrop.

Cooper arrived the sentry by Pinzgaur 710 high mobility vehicle, and began on duty at 23:00. Just after a few minutes, the sentry suffered fire from the enemy. Is that the war began? A few solider of Molatia Army rushed the sentry with their rifle firing. Cooper take them easily with the help of others. It seems that Molatia Army was overrated, said Cooper. However, it’s unbeknown that the conflict was directed by Molatia in order to get the pretext for invasion.
